# Assignment 3: Optimization of a City Transportation Network
By Madiyar Kenzhebayev SE-2407 for DAA 

## Project Overview
This project implements Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to find Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) for optimizing city transportation networks. The solution determines the most cost-effective set of roads connecting all city districts while minimizing total construction costs.


## Technologies Used
- **Java 11**
- **Maven** - Dependency management
- **Jackson** - JSON processing
- **JUnit** - Testing framework

## Features
- Implementation of both Prim's and Kruskal's MST algorithms
- JSON input/output processing
- Performance metrics tracking (execution time, operation count)
- Comprehensive test cases
- Modular and extensible architecture

### Test
- Run App.java

### Analysis of Algorithms:
- Please check docx report :D
